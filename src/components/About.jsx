              The French Bulldog, French: Bouledogue Fran√ßais, is a French breed of companion dog or toy dog. 
              It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of 
              Toy Bulldogs imported from England and local Parisian ratters.
              It is commonly kept as a pet, and is among the most frequently registered dogs in a number of 
              countries including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
